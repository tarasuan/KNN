Here is the dataset: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ga-dat-2015-suneel/datasets/bank-additional-full.csv

Here is a description of what the columns mean: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ga-dat-2015-suneel/datasets/bank-additional-names.txt

This is a dataset on a direct marketing campaign run by a Portuguese bank and the output y is whether or not they subscribed to a term deposit. 

In Part 1, apply k-Nearest Neighbors on subsets of the columns and using cross validation see how the accuracy changes. Then, use all of the columns for your kNN classifier and see what the accuracy is.

In Part 2, use logistic regression on the data, perhaps bucketing some of the column data into discrete categories rather than being continuous values. The try logistic regression on subsets of the columns.

In part 3, determine the following: Between logistic regression and kNN, which performed better in predicting which customers would sign on for a term deposit?
